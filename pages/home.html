<h1>The Days</h1><p>This is where I put all the writings from past days</p><h2>Day 1 <span class=small><a href=#/toExponential>Number.prototype.toExponential()</a></span></h2><p>For today I am looking at the <a href=#/toExponential><code>toExponential()</code></a> function that is part of the <code>number</code> prototype. Not the most exciting function, but I guess I have to start somewhere.</p><p>I'm still trying to decide how I go through each function, whether, alphabetically through each type, or if I just mix and match a few. I'm thinking that I will mix it up a little to help keep the blog interesting, incase I get bogged down in too much of one thing.</p><p>I've also decided to make this a little AngularJS project as well, so that I can keep sharp on building Single Page Applications (SPAs). At the moment the site is pretty bare, but I like it like that and it's good to really see the growth of the site. I think I will also start taking some screenshots so that I can see the evolution of how the page looks too.</p>
